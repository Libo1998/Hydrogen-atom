# Hydrogen-atom

Numerical and analytical solution of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the hydrogen atom.

It is used MATLAB for numerical solution of differential equation (Runge-Kutta and Numerov algorithm). It is used Processing for numerical and graphical simulation of the chaotic system.

The report, written in Latex, is avaiable in Italian-version.

Project conceived in the context of PAF extracurricular course held by prof. Francesco Pederiva at the University of Trento, a.y. 2018/2019.
